                <div class="bg-[#e5e5f7] p-4 ">
                    <p class="py-2">In 2017, the Lord laid it on my heart that Sister Esther was to be my wife. For weeks, I was confused and I told myself this must be a joke. </p>
                    <p class="py-2">I knew little or nothing about her, apart from the fact that we usually met at an Ekklesia meeting at Uncle JD&rsquo;s house.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">Also, I remembered sometimes ago in 2016, while I was working, cleaning and clearing the surroundings at White House, she and Sis. Abigail came to help. I believe this was the first time I saw her, and this was the meeting point.  </p>
                    <p class="py-2">From then onward, the next two years for me was full of contemplations, meditations, ponderings and a quest to gain more understanding about my wife and the future with whom the Lord will have to journey with me.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">I was going to prove the words I heard the Lord spoke to me. I remember telling Bro. Tolu, ChristoDavid what I was hearing. We prayed about it and I forgot about it.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">Thereafter, late 2019, it was as though the whole marriage thing was coming back, and this time, I felt and sensed so strongly that I had found the one! At this point, my doubt began to fade away, and love was growing constantly.  Romans 5 became my anchor verse.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">After graduating from the University, I was relieved from schoolwork and traveled home briefly. On my way to Jos, I had a book which served as a companion with me, titled ‚ÄúMessenger‚Äù. It was a study of the life of Pa S.G Elton and the history of Pentecostalism in Nigeria. I believe this book served as a blueprint for me in many ways, which includes marriage.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">Prior to that time, I had been doing research on business as a mission, but the stories in the book informed my understanding that marriage is also a mission.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">It was therefore with the mind of love and mission that I approached this damsel of mine on the 13th of February, 2020. </p>
                    <p class="py-2">On this fateful day, I woke up with so much passion for the business I started just some days ago, which was distributing fresh vegetables from Jos to restaurants in Ogbomoso. Meanwhile, I had pre-informed my mentor a day beforehand that I would be making my intentions known to her that day, so the courage was built up to speak.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">As I stacked my goods for delivery, I put a call through to her asking if we could meet in school (LAUTECH). She agreed, and we fixed a time to meet, since she was still a student, I planned to work with her schedule. </p>
                    <p class="py-2">Just after making a few deliveries, my phone rang and it was just the call I was expecting. ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù She was asking from the other end of the phone. I replied and we agreed to meet at the front of the Engineering Workshop.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">After exchanging pleasantries for some minutes, she thought I would be asking her about her last semester's results; but no, I was going to be asking her out! I was going to tell her that I love her and If she could consider me for marriage in the future.  And that was what I did! üòä</p>
                    <p class="py-2">I asked her if we could walk towards the direction of the school field, which she agreed to. When we got there, she asked if she could sit on one of the slabs in the field, and I gently told her I did not think that was necessary as we would soon be done. </p>
                    <p class="py-2">At this point I thought I needed some fresh air, but I summoned the courage to tell her that ‚ÄúI love you and I would like you to marry me‚Äù...</p>
                    <p class="py-2">It was a simple and short phrase, but saying it then was like years of speaking. She looked at me with a smile and again requested if she can sit down, at this point, I had to make her sit, the burden had been lifted.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">I can&rsquo;t remember much of the conversations but I can remember her telling me she will be praying about it and that I should give her time to speak with her mentors too.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">The next day, February 14, was Valentine&rsquo;s Day and that was the first day to this gracious countdown. All through, it's been a unfolding journey of beautiful things which God has purposed and preserved for us.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">This was the beginning.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">Thanks for following through in our journey and sharing in our joy! </p>
                    <p class="py-2">Next will be the story of the first day. Stay turned!</p>
